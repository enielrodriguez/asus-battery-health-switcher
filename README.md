# Asus速 Battery Health Switcher
KDE Plasma widget to turn on/off the Battery Health Charging feature in compatible Asus速 laptops.  

Keep in mind that according to some reports of users on the Internet this mode is automatically disabled after rebooting. 
To make it permanent you can do it for example with a cronjob **(with that you would not need this widget)**.  
See [Battery Charging limiter Linux (ASUS Laptops)](https://github.com/sreejithag/battery-charging-limiter-linux) or [Enable Asus Battery Health Charging (Charging Threshold) in Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BacV_hvaXfU).

## Install

### KDE Store
[Asus速 Battery Health Switcher - KDE Store](https://store.kde.org/p/2075212/)

### Manual
- Download/clone this repo.
- Run from a terminal the command `plasmapkg2 -i [widget folder name]`.

## Disclaimer
I'm not a widget or KDE developer, I did this by looking at other widgets, using AI chatbots, consulting documentation, etc. So use it at your own risk.
Any recommendations and contributions are welcome.
