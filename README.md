# Asus速 Battery Health Switcher
KDE Plasma widget to configure the Battery Health Charging feature in compatible Asus速 laptops.  
For more information see [ASUS Battery Health Charging](https://www.asus.com/us/support/FAQ/1032726/)

Keep in mind that according to some reports of users on the Internet this mode is automatically disabled after rebooting. 
To make it permanent you can do it for example with a cronjob or with Systemd **(with either of these two ways you would not need this widget)**.  
See [Battery Charging limiter Linux (ASUS Laptops)](https://github.com/sreejithag/battery-charging-limiter-linux) or [Enable Asus Battery Health Charging (Charging Threshold) in Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BacV_hvaXfU).

## Install

- Version **0.0.1** only gives two possible modes, **on** (60%) or **off** (100%).

## Disclaimer
I'm not a widget or KDE developer, I did this by looking at other widgets, using AI chatbots, consulting documentation, etc. So use it at your own risk.
Any recommendations and contributions are welcome.
